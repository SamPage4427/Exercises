My name is Sam Page. I live in Aurora, Colorado. 

I have a Bachelor of Science in Multimedia Journalism. I originally went to school for engineering but was not to keen on the amount of calculus I would need to complete.

I switched my major to Computer Programming but my first professor did not want to answer any questions when I was struggling so I ended up dropping the class and became a journalism major. 

My hobbies include playing the guitar, playing video games, working on cars, taking photos and videos with my camera, and hanging out with friends.

My favorite food is chicken and waffles.
